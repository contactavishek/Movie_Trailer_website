Project: Movie Trailer Website
By Avishek Mitra

Steps required to successfully run the application:
•	Extract compressed file
•	Run the application, entertainment.py
•	This will open up a page in your web browser
•	Hover over the movie poster to view short movie Storyline (this is my addition)
•	Click on the movie poster to see YouTube trailer

What's included in the zip file:

Excluding the README.md file there are three python files:
•	entertainment.py - The main python script to run. It builds the movie list and calls the function to generate the web page.
•	fresh_tomatoes.py - The provided web page generator (Udacity supplied). It takes in a list of movies and builds the HTML and opens up your default browser to display the generated HTML page.
•	movietrailer.py - Contains the class that provides the data structure to store movie information.

A fourth file, Movie_trailers.html, will be generated when you run the program as described above. This file is the actual web page you would see in your browser.
